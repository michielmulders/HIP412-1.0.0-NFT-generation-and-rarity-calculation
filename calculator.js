// get size first? (user should size variable! CONSTANT in script)
// read all nft metadatas in memory
// goal is to calculate rarity score based on purely metadata (not looking at my config)
// check number of attributes
// create object with the different traits
// loop over all NFT objects and start counting value "yellow" and +1

// then when we have all data we can calculate rarity for each NFT (maybe already load them into memory so it's easier to calculate)
